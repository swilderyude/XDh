AB Computer-based systems that support health care require large controlled terminologies to manage names and meanings of data elements. These terminologies are not static, because change in health care is inevitable. To share data and applications in health care, we need standards not only for terminologies and concept representation, but also for representing change. To develop a principled approach to managing change, we analyze the requirements of controlled medical terminologies and consider features that frame knowledge-representation systems have to offer. Based on our analysis, we present a concept model, a set of change operations, and a change-documentation model that may be appropriate for controlled terminologies in health care. We are currently implementing our modeling approach within a computational architecture. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Relevance weighting for combining multi-domain data for <i>n</i>-gram language modeling
SO COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE
LA English
DT Article
AB Standard statistical language modeling techniques suffer from sparse-data problems in tasks where large amounts of domain-specific text are not available. In this paper, we focus on improving the estimation of domain-dependent n-gram models by the selective use of out-of-domain text data. Previous approaches for estimating language models from multi-domain data have not accounted for the characteristic variations of style and content across domains. In contrast, this work aims at differentially weighting subsets of the out-of-domain data according to style and/or content similarity to the given task, where "style" is represented by part-of-speech statistics and "content" by the particular choice of vocabulary items. In addition to n-gram estimation, the differential weights can be used for lexicon design. Recognition experiments are based on the Switchboard corpus of spontaneous conversations, with out-of-domain text drawn from the Wall Street Journal and Broadcast News corpora. The similarity weighting approach gives a 3-5% reduction in word error rate over a domain-specific n-gram language model, providing some of the largest language modeling gains reported for the Switchboard task in recent years.

TI Confidence measures from local posterior probability estimates
SO COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE
LA English
DT Article
AB In this paper we introduce a set of related confidence measures for large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) based on local phone posterior probability estimates output by an acceptor HMM acoustic model. In addition to their computational efficiency, these confidence measures are attractive as they may be applied at the state-, phone-, word- or utterance-levels, potentially enabling discrimination between different causes of low confidence recognizer output, such as unclear acoustics or mismatched pronunciation models. We have evaluated these confidence measures for utterance verification using a number of different metrics. Experiments reveal several trends in "profitability of rejection", as measured by the unconditional error rate of a hypothesis test. These trends suggest that crude pronunciation models can mask the relatively subtle reductions in confidence caused by out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words and disfluencies, but not the gross model mismatches elicited by non-speech sounds. The observation that a purely acoustic confidence measure can provide improved performance over a measure based upon both acoustic and language model information for data drawn from the Broadcast News corpus, but not for data drawn from the North American Business News corpus suggests that the quality of model fit offered by a trigram language model is reduced for Broadcast News data. We also argue that acoustic confidence measures may be used to inform the search for improved pronunciation models. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

DT Article
AB In this paper, we describe a framework for developing probabilistic classifiers in natural language processing. Our focus is on formulating models that capture the most important interdependencies among features, to avoid overfitting the data while also characterizing the data well. The class of probability models and the associated inference techniques described here were developed in mathematical statistics, and are widely used in artificial intelligence and applied statistics. Our goal is to make this model selection framework accessible to researchers in NLP, and provide pointers to available software and important references. In addition, toe describe how the quality of the three determinants of classifier performance (the features, the form of the model, and the parameter estimates) can be separately evaluated. We also demonstrate the classification performance of these models in a large-scale experiment involving the disambiguation of 34 words taken from the HECTOR word sense corpus (Hanks 1996). In 10-fold cross-validations, the model search procedure performs significantly better than naive Bayes on 6 of the words without being significantly worse on any of them.

AB A new compact and homogeneous symbolism is introduced to achieve a more general and exact representation of natural language texts. Traditional first-order and intensional logic cannot cope with numerous natural language phenomena such as the large variety of modalities, satisfactory interpretation of iterative application of modal operators or certain modelling problems like one-to-one sentence-formula mapping. The CTRL/iCTRL formalism can model them successfully and they are able to control many other different shades of meaning by applying only a minimal number of syntactic tools. The most profitable and beneficial Al application of the presented natural language syntax consistent knowledge representation technique is automated knowledge acquisition: computer-aided textual data base generation and logical inference based information retrieval. CTRL/iCTRL applicability is demonstrated by various illustrative examples including a transparent graphical interpretation analogous to Frege's graph language that help clarify new concepts and exemplify partial inappropriateness of traditional logical language. The CTRL/iCTRL paradigm is based on a novel and interesting synthesis of the two traditional logic schools, the Stoic and the Peripatetic school, refuting a century long scientific prejudice against the latter stated to be completely outworn. An interesting issue of this analysis points out that expressing subordination unconsciously and simply by co-ordination causes a typical restriction of meaning in classical logic.

TI Syntactic-semantic tagging as a mediator between linguistic representations and formal models: an exercise in linking SNOMED to GALEN
SO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE concept representation; linguistic semantics; syntactic-semantic tagging; natural language understanding; automated knowledge acquisition
AB Natural language understanding applications are good candidates to solve the knowledge acquisition bottleneck when designing large scale concept systems. However, a necessary condition is that systems are built that transform sentences into a meaning representation that is independent of the subtleties of linguistic structure that nevertheless underly the way language works. The Cassandra II syntactic-semantic tagging system fulfills this goal partially. Within the GALEN-IN-USE project, it is used to transform linguistic representations of surgical procedure expressions into conceptual representations. In this paper, the proctology chapter of the SNOMED V3.1 procedure axis was used as a testbed to evaluate the usefulness of this approach. A quantitative and qualitative analysis of the data obtained is presented, showing that the Cassandra system can indeed complement the manual modelling efforts being conducted in the GALEN-IN-USE project. The different requirements related to linguistic modelling versus conceptual modelling can partly be accounted for by using an interface ontology, of which the fine tuning will however remain an important effort.

AB Probabilistic models provide a sound and coherent foundation for dealing with the noise and uncertainty encountered in most real-world domains. Bayesian networks are a language for representing complex probabilistic models in a compact and natural way. A Bayesian network can be used to reason about any attribute in the domain, given any set of observations. It can thus be used for a variety tasks, including prediction, explanation, and decision making. The probabilistic semantics also gives a strong foundation for the task of learning models from data. Techniques currently exist for learning both the structure and the parameters, for dealing with missing data and hidden variables, and for discovering causal structure. One of the main limitations of Bayesian networks is that they represent the world in terms of a fixed set of "attributes". Like propositional logic, they are incapable of reasoning explicitly about entities, and thus cannot represent models over domains where the set of entities and the relations between them are not fixed in advance. As a consequence, Bayesian networks are limited in their ability to model large and complex domains. Probabilistic relational models are a language for describing probabilistic models based on the significantly more expressive basis of relational logic. They allow the domain to be represented in terms of entities, their properties, and the relations between them. These models represent the uncertainty over the properties of an entity, representing its probabilistic dependence both on other properties of that entity and on properties of related entities. They can even represent uncertainty over the relational structure itself. Some of the techniques for Bayesian network learning can be generalized to this setting, but the learning problem is far from solved. Probabilistic relational models provide a new framework, and new challenges, for the endeavor of learning relational models for real-world domains.

DE semantic relations; knowledge representation; formal concept analysis
AB In this paper we develop a formalization of semantic relations that facilitates efficient implementations of relations in lexical databases or knowledge representation systems using bases. The formalization of relations is based on a modeling of hierarchical relations in Formal Concept Analysis. Further, relations are analyzed according to Relational Concept Analysis, which allows a representation of semantic relations consisting of relational components and quantificational tags. This representation utilizes mathematical properties of semantic relations. The quantificational tags imply inheritance rules among semantic relations that can be used to check the consistency of relations and to reduce the redundancy in implementations by storing only the basis elements of semantic relations. The research presented in this paper is an example of an application of Relational Concept Analysis to lexical databases and knowledge representation systems (cf. Priss 1996) which is pan of a larger framework of research on natural language analysis and formalization.

AB An implemented model of language processing has been developed that views the propositional components of a sentence as neural units. The propositional sentence units are linked through symbolic, reified representations of subordinate sentence parts. Large numbers of these highly standardized propositional units are encoded in a manner that interconnects propositional data through the declarative knowledge base structures, thus minimizing the importance of the procedural component and the need for backward chaining and inference generation The introduction of new sentence information triggers a connectionist-like flurry of activity in which constantly changing propositional weights and reification strengths effect changes in the belief states encoded within the knowledge base.

AB We present an efficient method for maintaining mixtures of prunings of a prediction or decision tree that extends the previous methods for "node-based" prunings (Buntine, 1990; Willems, Shtarkov, & Tjalkens, 1995; Helmbold & Schapire, 1997; Singer, 1997) to the larger class of edge-based prunings. The method includes an online weight-allocation algorithm that can be used for prediction, compression and classification. Although the set of edge-based prunings of a given tree is much larger than that of node-based prunings, our algorithm has similar space and time complexity to that of previous mixture algorithms for trees. Using the general online framework of Freund and Schapire (1997), we prove that our algorithm maintains correctly the mixture weights for edge-based prunings with any bounded loss function. We also give a similar algorithm for the logarithmic loss function with a corresponding weight-allocation algorithm. Finally, we describe experiments comparing node-based and edge-based mixture models for estimating the probability of the next word in English text, which show the advantages of edge-based models.

Predictions for the large vowel systems of the world's languages using the Maximum Use of Available distinctive Features (MUAF) principle are discussed. Simulations of the use of supplementary phonetic features in large vowel systems axe presented. These experimental results show how simple local rules of interaction between speaking agents are sufficient to explain some of the universal characteristics of the phonological structure of the world's languages.

TI Specification of multimedia software systems using an object oriented architecture description language
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB Despite the growing importance of multimedia applications, we still know relatively little about how to specify, design, and maintain this class of complex applications in a systematic manner. The concept of software architecture has recently emerged as a way to improve our ability to effectively construct and maintain large-scale complex software systems. Under this new paradigm, software engineers are able to do evolutionary design of complex systems through architecture specification, design rationale capture, architecture validation and verification, and architecture transformation. Several architecture description languages (ADLs), such as Wright, Rapide, UniCon, ACME, etc, have been proposed to support the architecture development under this new software paradigm. Although current ADLs more or less support certain features of object-oriented design approach, few of them are purely based on object-oriented paradigm. In this paper, we present an architecture description language - OOADL (Object-Oriented Architecture Description Language) to facilitate the architecture specification of multimedia software systems. This language takes object-oriented paradigm as its backbone, and provides formal semantics for modeling architectures of software systems. It also aims at other goals such as, support for hierarchical refinement, support for reuse of architecture styles, support for analysis, and support for exception handling. We also introduce the default architecture style which brings the features of extensibility and re-usability into the language. Finally, we use OOADL to construct part of the architecture framework of a multimedia system to illustrate the usage and modeling capability of OOADL.

DE diagnosis; model-based reasoning; debugging
ID algorithm
AB The state of the art in hardware design is the use of hardware description languages such as VHDL. The designs are tested by simulating them and comparing their output to that prescribed by the specification. A significant part of the design effort is spent on detecting unacceptable deviations from this specification and subsequently localizing the sources of such faults. In this paper, we describe an approach to employ model-based diagnosis for fault detection and localization in very large VHDL programs, by automatically generating the diagnosis model from the VHDL code and using observations about the program behavior to derive possible fault locations from the model. In order to achieve sufficient performance for practical applicability, we have developed a representation that provides a highly abstracted view of programs and faults, but is sufficiently detailed to yield substantial reductions in the fault localization costs when compared to the current manpower-intensive approach. The implementation in conjunction with the knowledge representation is designed with openness in mind in order to facilitate use of the highly optimized simulation tools available.

AB In this article, we introduce a knowledge-based approach to medical text understanding. From an in-depth consideration of deep sentence and text understanding we distill basic requirements for an adequate knowledge representation framework. These requirements are then matched with currently available medical ontologies (thesauri, terminologies, etc.). A fundamental trade-off is recognized between large-scale conceptual coverage on the one hand, and formal mechanisms for integrity preservation and conceptual expressiveness on the ether hand. We discuss various shortcomings of the most wide-spread ontologies to capture medical knowledge in-the-large. As a result, we argue for the need of a formally sound and expressive model along the lines of KL-ONE-style terminological representation systems in the format of description logics. These provide an adequate methodology for designing more sophisticated, flexible medical ontologies serving the needs of 'deep' knowledge applications which are by no means restricted to medical language processing.

AB We address the problem of morpho-syntactic disambiguation of arbitrary texts in a highly inflectional natural language. We use a large tagset (615 tags), EAGLES and MULTEXT compliant [5]. The large tagset is internally mapped onto a reduced one (82 tags), serving statistical disambiguation, and a text disambiguated in terms of this tagset is subsequently subject to a recovery process of all the information left out from the large tagset. This two step process is called ties-ed tagging. To further improve the tagging accuracy we use a combined language models classifier, a procedure that interpolates the results of tagging the game text with several register-specific language models.

TI Information theoretic based segments for language identification
SO TEXT, SPEECH AND DIALOGUE

DT Article; Proceedings Paper
AB In our paper we present two new approaches for language identification. Both of them are based on the use of so-called multigrams, an information theoretic based observation representation. In the first approach we use multigram models for phonotactic modeling of phoneme or codebook sequences. The multigram model can be used to segment the new observation into larger units (e.g. something like words) and calculates a probability for the best segmentation. In the second approach we build a fenon recognizer using the segments of the best segmentation of the training material as "words" inside the recognition vocabulary. On the OGI test corpus and on the NLST'95 evaluation corpus we got significant improvements with this second approach in comparison to the unsupervised codebook approach when discriminating between English and German utterances.

TI Interpolation of n-gram and mutual-information based trigger pair language models for Mandarin speech recognition
SO COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE
LA English
DT Article
AB While n-gram modeling is simple and dominant in speech recognition, it can only capture the short-distance context dependency within an n-word window where currently the largest practical n for natural language is three. However, many of the context dependencies in natural language occur beyond a three-word window. This paper proposes a new language modeling approach to capture the preferred relationships between words over a short or long distance through the concept of MI-Trigger pairs. Different MI-Trigger-based models are constructed in either a distance-dependent or a distance-independent way within a window from 1 to 10 words. This new MI-Trigger-based modeling is also compared and merged with word bigram modeling. It is found that the MI-Trigger-based modeling has better performance than word bigram modeling. It is also found that n-gram and MI-Trigger models have good complementarity and their proper merging can further increase the recognition rate when tested on Mandarin speech recognition. One advantage of MI-Trigger-based modeling is that the number of parameters needed for MI-Trigger modeling is much less than that of word bigram modeling. Another advantage is that the number of trigger pairs in an MI-Trigger model can be kept to a reasonable size without losing too much of its modeling power. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

AB "See" is a software framework for simulation of biologically detailed and artificial neural networks and systems. It includes an general purpose scripting language, based on Scheme, which also can be used interactively, while the basic framework is written in C++. Models can be built on the Scheme level from "simulation objects", each representing a population of neurons, a projection, etc. The simulator provides a flexible and efficient protocol for data transfer between such objects. See contains a user interface to the parallelized, platform independent, library SPLIT intended for biologically detailed modeling of large-scale networks and is easy to extend with new user code, both on the C++ and Scheme levels.

TI Automatic selection of phonetically distributed sentence sets for speaker adaptation with application to large vocabulary Mandarin speech recognition
SO COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE

DT Article
ID hidden markov-models
AB This paper presents an approach of automatic selection of phonetically distributed sentence sets for speaker adaptation, and applies the concept to the task of Mandarin speech recognition with very large vocabulary. This is a different approach to the adaptation data selection problem. A computer algorithm is developed to select minimum sets of phonetically distributed training sentences from a text corpus defining the desired task. These sentence sets not only include an almost minimum number of words and sentences that cover the desired acoustic units, but also have statistical distributions of these acoustic phonetic units very close to that in the given text corpus defining the desired task. In this way, more frequently used units can be better trained with higher accuracy, thus improving the overall performance, but the new user needs to produce only a small number of meaningful sentences to train the recognizer. Different sets of sentences selected using different phonetic criteria taking into consideration the statistics of the different acoustic units in the given corpus can then be integrated into a multi-stage adaptation procedure. With this procedure, the recognition performance can be improved incrementally stage by stage using the adaptation data produced with these sentence sets. This proposed approach is applied to an example task of Mandarin speech recognition with a very large vocabulary, both in isolated syllable and continuous speech modes and includes different subject domains in continuous speech recognition. Although the primary results obtained in this paper are for this example task, it is believed that many of the concepts and techniques developed here will also be very useful for other speaker adaptation problems and other languages.

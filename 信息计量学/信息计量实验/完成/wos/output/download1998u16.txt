AB Database systems based on the relational model have become very popular for the storage of large volumes of business-related data. Although the relational model provides a great range of advantages over other data models, it was designed to support deterministic data and, consequently, it lacks a comprehensive way for handling uncertain data. However, in all real-world environments, uncertainty in data values is a common occurrence. Therefore, there is a need to extend the relational model so that data uncertainty can be captured explicitly. In an earlier work, we have proposed a probabilistic relational algebra that is a consistent extension of the conventional relational algebra and is reducible to the latter. The contribution of this work is the development of a non-procedural probabilistic query language-structured around the popular SQL-that can be built on top of that algebra. We formalize the extended syntax, provide examples to illustrate the syntax, and examine query formulation from a decision-theoretic perspective (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI Incremental verification of architecture specification language for real-time systems

DT Article

AB The concept of software architecture has recently emerged as a new way to improve our ability to effectively construct large scale software systems. However, there is no formal architecture specification language available to model and analyze temporal properties of complex real-time systems. In this paper, an object-oriented logic-based architecture specification language for real-time systems is discussed. Representation of the temporal properties and timing constraints, and their integration with the language to model real-time concurrent systems is given. Architecture based specification languages enable the construction of large system architectures and provide a means of testing and validation. In general, checking the timing constraints of real-time systems is done by applying model checking to the constraint expressed as a formula in temporal logic. The complexity of such a formal method depends on the size of the representation of the system. It is possible that this size could increase exponentially when the system consists of several concurrently executing real-time processes. This means that the complexity of the algorithm will be exponential in the number of processes of the system and thus the size of the system becomes a limiting factor. Such a problem has been defined in the literature as "state explosion problem". We propose a method of incremental verification of architectural specifications for real-time systems. The method has a lower complexity in a sense that it does not work on the whole state space, but only on a subset of it that is relevant to the property to be verified.

AB Process algebra are formal languages used for the rigorous specification and analysis of concurrent systems. By using a process algebra as the target language of a genetic programming system, the derivation of concurrent programs satisfying given problem specifications is possible. A genetic programming system based on Koza's model has been implemented. The target language used is Milner's CCS process algebra, and is chosen for its conciseness and simplicity. The genetic programming environment needs a few adaptations to the computational characteristics of concurrent programs. In particular, means for efficiently controlling the exponentially large computation spaces that are common with process algebra must be addressed. Experimental runs of the system successfully evolved a number of non-iterative CCS systems, hence proving the potential of evolutionary approaches to concurrent system development.

DE configuration design; system design; knowledge-based systems; case-based reasoning; constraints
AB A fixed set of components with a fixed set of properties is often regarded as a defining characteristic of configuration design problems. In configuration design for larger and more complex systems (e.g., street cars), however, this often is not really true. The reason is that sometimes the component library offers no component that meets the actual requirements, so that a new component has to be added to the library. In general, configuration design for larger products must be interactive: interactive in the sense that the user controls the configuration process and in the sense that the phases of knowledge acquisition and configuration are partly mixed. This paper describes a method and a corresponding software tool (SyDeR, System Design for Reusability) that support the interactive configuration design of complex products, especially in the tendering phase. It combines three different technologies: structural modeling of technical systems; a library for technical solutions, which is based upon taxonomies and allows the reuse of the technical solutions; constraint techniques to propagate design decisions and check designs for consistency to support interactive configuration design. This paper gives an overview of the functionality of the SyDeR tool and describes the main ideas behind the modeling language, which is especially oriented towards the requirements of system design problems. It also explains how we integrated structural modeling, taxonomies, and advanced constraint reasoning techniques into real-world applications.

AB This paper describes the technical principles and representation behind the constraint-based, automated configurator COCOS. Traditionally, representation methods for technical configuration have focused either on reasoning about structure of systems or quantity of components, which is not satisfactory in many target areas that need both. Starting from general requirements on configuration systems, we have developed an extension of the standard CSP model. The constraint-based approach allows a simple system architecture, and a declarative description of the different types of configuration knowledge. Knowledge bases are described in terms of a component-centered knowledge base written in an object-oriented representation language with semantics directly based an the underlying constraint model. The approach combines a simple, declarative representation with the ability to configure large-scale systems and is in use for actual production applications.

AB The EVA (espacios virtuales de aprendizaje, or virtual learning spaces) project applies artificial intelligence tools to teleteaching methods, in a way that eliminates or mitigates the need for synchronous and in situ education. (A) A taxonomy of the space of knowledge (also called 'Learning Space'; currently our prototype teaches M.Sc. courses in Computer Science) is formed and discretized. (B) EVA finds each student's initial knowledge state (through a computer examination:) and final (desired) knowledge state, and from these, a particular learning trajectory is designed for that student. (C) Personalized books (called polybooks, because they are formed by modules (chapters) written in a variety of media) are armed by concatenating - along the learning trajectory - modules from a large pool, and sent to the student through the net in a store-and-forward fashion. (D) EVA searches the net for teaching material which has not been indexed in the discretized learning space, using a tool (Clasitex) inside an agent that finds the main themes or topics that an article (written in natural language) covers. (E) EVA also schedules for each student synchronous activities (lectures in TV, teleconferences, on-line question and answering sessions, chats). (F) EVA suggests for each student suitable 'classmates' (students having similar learning trajectories) in her town, as well as possible advisers (students or alumni having knowledge that the student is acquiring). The present status, problems, models and tools of EVA are presented. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Contextual grammars as generative models of natural languages
SO COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
LA English
DT Article
AB The paper discusses some classes of contextual grammars-mainly those with "maximal use of selectors"-giving some arguments that these grammars can be considered a goon model for natural language syntax. A contextual grammar produces a language starting from a finite set of words and iteratively adding contexts to the currently generated words, according to a selection procedure: each context has associated with it a selector, a set of words; the context is adjoined to any occurrence of such a selector in the word to be derived. In grammars with maximal use of selectors, a context is adjoined only to selectors for which no superword is a selector. Maximality can be defined either locally or globally (with respect to all selectors in the grammar). The obtained families of languages are incomparable with that of Chomsky context-free languages land with other families of languages that contain linear languages and that are not "too large"; see Section 5) and have a series of properties supporting the assertion that these grammars are a possible adequate model for the syntax of natural languages. They are able to straightforwardly describe all the usual restrictions appearing in natural (and artificial) languages, which lead to the non-context-freeness of these languages: reduplication, crossed dependencies, and multiple agreements; however, there are center-embedded constructions that cannot be covered by these grammars. While these assertions concern only the weak generative capacity of contextual grammars, some ideas are also proposed for associating a structure to the generated words, in the form of a tree, or of a dependence relation (as considered in descriptive linguistics and also similar to that in link grammars).

TI Approximate reasoning about combined knowledge
SO INTELLIGENT AGENTS IV: AGENT THEORIES, ARCHITECTURES, AND LANGUAGES
LA English
DT Article; Proceedings Paper
ID bases; counterfactuals
AB Just as cooperation in multi-agent systems is a central issue for solving complex decision problems, so too is the ability for an intelligent agent to reason about combined knowledge, coming from its background knowledge and the communicated information. Specifically, such an agent is confronted with three main difficulties: the prospect of inconsistency which arises when different beliefs are grouped together, the presence of uncertainty which may occur due to not fully reliable beliefs, and the high computational complexity of reasoning with very large pools of collected information. The purpose of this paper is to define a formal framework which handles these three aspects and which is useful to specify resource bounded agents. Based on the concept of approximate reasoning, our framework includes several major features. First, a model checking approach is advocated, which enables an agent to perform decidable reasoning with a first-order representation language. Second, a stepwise procedure is included for improving approximate answers and allowing their convergence to the correct answer. Third and finally, both sound approximations and complete ones are covered. This method is flexible enough for modeling tractable reasoning in very large, inconsistent and uncertain sets of knowledge.

AB This article introduces the basic segmentation problems in Chinese handwriting and also several prior work to solve these problems. A new segmentation method is proposed, which is applicable to both on-line and off-line systems for free-format handwritten Chinese character sentences. This method performs basic segmentation and fine segmentation based on the varying spacing thresholds and the minimum variance criteria. The five most probable ways of segmentation are derived from this stage and all the possible segments are extracted and recognized. A lattice is created from all the segments and searched using a viterbi based algorithm to find the most likely character sequence. The algorithm presented in this paper provides large flexibility and robustness to handle free-format continuous Chinese handwriting and is a promising solution for a natural and fast Chinese pen input system. The character accuracy is 85.0% for on-line and 77.4% for the off-line test data.

AB A knowledge-based approach to retrieve medical images by feature and content with spatial and temporal constructs is developed. Selected objects of interest in a medical image (e.g., x-ray, MR image) are segmented, and contours are generated from these objects. Features (e.g., shape, size, texture) and content (e.g., spatial relationships among objects) are extracted and stored in a feature and content database. Knowledge about image features can be expressed as a hierarchical structure called a Type Abstraction Hierarchy (TAH). The high-level nodes in the TAH represent more general concepts than low-level nodes. Thus, traversing along TAH nodes allows approximate matching by feature and content if an exact match is not available. TAHs can be generated automatically by clustering algorithms based on feature values in the databases and hence are scalable to large collections of image features. Further, since TAHs are generated based on user classes and applications, they are context- and user-sensitive. A knowledge-based semantic image model is proposed that consists of four layers (raw data layer, feature and content layer, schema layer, and knowledge layer) to represent the various aspects of an image objects' characteristics. The model provides a mechanism for accessing and processing spatial, evolutionary and temporal queries. A knowledge-based spatial temporal query language (KSTL) has developed that extends ODMG's OQL and supports approximate matching of feature and content, conceptual terms, and temporal logic predicates. Further, a visual query language has been developed that accepts point click-and-drag visual iconic input on the screen that is then translated into KSTL. User models are introduced to provide default parameter values for specifying query conditions. We have implemented a Knowledge-Based Medical Database System (KMeD) at UCLA, and it is currently under evaluation by the medical staff. The results from this research should be applicable to other multimedia information systems as well.

AB The mechanisms underlying cerebral lateralization of language are poorly understood. Asymmetries in the size of hemispheric regions and other factors have been suggested as possible underlying causal factors, and the corpus callosum (interhemispheric connections) has also been postulated to play a role. To examine these issues, we created a neural model consisting of paired cerebral hemispheric regions interacting via the corpus callosum. The model was trained to generate the correct sequence of phonemes for 50 monosyllabic words (simulated reading aloud) under a variety of assumptions about hemispheric asymmetries and callosal effects. After training, the ability of the full model and each hemisphere acting alone to perform this task was measured. Lateralization occurred readily toward the side having larger size, higher excitability, or higher learning-rate parameter. Lateralization appeared most readily and intensely with strongly inhibitory callosal connections, supporting past arguments that the effective functionality of the corpus callosum is inhibitory. Many of the results are interpretable as the outcome of a "race to learn" between the model's two hemispheric regions, leading to the concept that asymmetric hemispheric plasticity is a critical common causative factor in lateralization. To our knowledge, this is the first computational model to demonstrate spontaneous lateralization of function, and it suggests that such models can be useful for understanding the mechanisms of cerebral lateralization.

AB Natural language understanding involves the simultaneous consideration of a large number of different sources of information. Traditional methods employed in language analysis have focused on developing powerful formalisms to represent syntactic or semantic structures along with rules for transforming language into these formalisms, However, they make use of only small subsets of knowledge. This article will describe how to use the whole range of information through a neurosymbolic architecture which is a hybridization of a symbolic network and subsymbol vectors generated from a connectionist network. Besides initializing the symbolic network with prior knowledge, the subsymbol vectors are used to enhance the system's capability in disambiguation and provide flexibility in sentence understanding. The model captures a diversity of information including word associations, syntactic restrictions, case-role expectations, semantic rules and context. It attains highly interactive processing by representing knowledge in an associative network on which actual semantic inferences are performed. An integrated use of previously analyzed sentences in understanding is another important feature of our model. The model dynamically selects one hypothesis among multiple hypotheses. This notion is supported by three simulations which show the degree of disambiguation relies both on the amount of linguistic rules and the semantic-associative information available to support the inference processes in natural language understanding. Unlike many similar systems, our hybrid system is more sophisticated in tackling language disambiguation problems by using linguistic clues from disparate sources as well as modeling context effects into the sentence analysis. It is potentially more powerful than any systems relying on one processing paradigm.

AB Machine Learning algorithms are being increasingly used for knowledge discovery tasks. Approaches can be broadly divided by distinguishing discovery of procedural from that of declarative knowledge. Client requirements determine which of these is appropriate. This paper discusses an experimental application of machine learning in an area related to drug design. The bottleneck here is in finding appropriate constraints to reduce the large number of candidate molecules to be synthesised and tested. Such constraints can be viewed as declarative specifications of the structural elements necessary for high medicinal activity and low toxicity. The first-order representation used within Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) provides an appropriate description language for such constraints. Within this application area knowledge accreditation requires not only a demonstration of predictive accuracy but also, and crucially, a certification of novel insight into the structural chemistry. This paper describes an experiment in which the ILP system Progol was used to obtain structural constraints associated with mutagenicity of molecules. In doing so Progol found a new indicator of mutagenicity within a subset of previously published data. This subset was already known not to be amenable to statistical regression, though its complement was adequately explained by a linear model. According to the combined accuracy/explanation criterion provided in this paper, on both subsets comparative trials show that Progol's structurally-oriented hypotheses are preferable to those of other machine learning algorithms.

AB We describe a statistical algorithm for machine translation intended to provide translations of large document collections at speeds far in excess of traditional machine translation systems, and of sufficiently high quality to perform information retrieval on the translated document collections. The model is trained from a parallel corpus and is capable of disambiguating senses of words. Information retrieval (IR) experiments on a French language dataset from a recent cross-language information retrieval evaluation yields results superior to those obtained by participants in the evaluation, and confirm the importance of word sense disambiugation in cross-language information retrieval.
